## üìò Project I ‚Äì Cholesky Factorization  

**Goal:**  
Implement and analyze the **Cholesky decomposition**, which factorizes a symmetric and positive-definite matrix into the product of a lower triangular matrix and its transpose.  

**Highlights:**  
- Verification of matrix symmetry and positive-definiteness.  
- Step-by-step implementation of the decomposition algorithm.  
- Error handling for non-positive-definite matrices.  
- Comparison with analytical results.  

**Usage:**  
The script `cholesky.py` demonstrates the factorization process using example matrices.

## üìò Project II ‚Äì ODE Solvers and Population Growth  

**Goal:**  
Apply numerical methods to solve **initial value problems (IVPs)** and model **population growth dynamics**.  

**Part I ‚Äì IVPs:**  
- Implementation of **Improved Euler** and **Runge-Kutta 4th Order (RK4)** methods.  
- Comparison of numerical approximations with the analytical solution.  
- Visualization of results with **Matplotlib**.  

**Part II ‚Äì Population Growth:**  
- Modeling population growth using the **logistic differential equation**.  
- Solution obtained with **`scipy.integrate.odeint`**.  
- Comparison with the exact analytical solution.  
- Export of results to an **Excel table** with computed errors.  

**Usage:**  
Run `projetoII_calcnum.py` to:  
- Generate and plot the numerical vs analytical solutions for the IVP.  
- Compute population growth with `odeint` and export results to Excel.
